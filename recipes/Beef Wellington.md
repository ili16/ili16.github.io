# Beef Wellington

## Ingredients
- 1.5 to 2 pounds beef tenderloin, trimmed
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 8 ounces mixed mushrooms, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 6 slices prosciutto
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)
- 1 cup pâté (optional, such as liver pâté or mushroom pâté)
- 1 package (14 ounces) puff pastry, thawed
- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Beef
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Season the beef tenderloin generously with salt and pepper.
3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. Sear the beef on all sides for about 2-3 minutes until browned. Remove from heat and let it cool.
4. Once cooled, brush the beef with Dijon mustard and set aside.

### Step 2: Prepare the Mushroom Duxelles
1. In the same skillet, add the finely chopped mushrooms and thyme. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the moisture has evaporated and the mixture is dry. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
2. Remove from heat and let it cool. 

### Step 3: Assemble the Wellington
1. On a clean surface, lay out a sheet of plastic wrap. Place the slices of prosciutto on the wrap, slightly overlapping them into a rectangle large enough to encase the beef.
2. Spread the cooled mushroom mixture evenly over the prosciutto.
3. If using, spread an even layer of pâté on top of the mushrooms.
4. Place the beef in the center and using the plastic wrap, roll the prosciutto and mushrooms tightly around the beef, twisting the ends of the plastic wrap to secure. Chill in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.

### Step 4: Wrap in Puff Pastry
1. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a rectangle large enough to fully cover the beef.
2. Remove the plastic wrap from the beef roll. Place the beef in the center of the pastry.
3. Fold the pastry over the beef, trimming any excess while ensuring the beef is completely sealed. Press the edges to seal and decorate as desired.
4. Brush the outside of the puff pastry with the beaten egg mixed with 2 tablespoons of water for a golden finish.

### Step 5: Bake the Wellington
1. Place the wrapped Beef Wellington on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
2. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and the internal temperature of the beef reaches 130°F (54°C) for medium rare.
3. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

### Step 6: Serve
1. Slice the Beef Wellington into thick pieces and serve with your choice of sides, such as roasted vegetables or a rich red wine sauce. Enjoy!
